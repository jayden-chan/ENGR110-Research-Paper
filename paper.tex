\section{Introduction}
The recent surge in computational power and dataset availability has led to a significant increase in the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) \cite{chan17}. In addition to this, advances in microelectronics and network infrastructure have enabled hardware manufacturers to create internet-connected devices for use in homes and businesses. This technology is commonly referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT). The combination of these two systems can aid significantly in the development of sustainable homes and businesses. Network-enabled cyber-physical devices capable of gathering data from their surroundings can provide optimization algorithms with the data they need to improve automation, energy use efficiency, and [placeholder]. Integrating these technologies, however, is not without its challenges, the biggest of which involve ethical concerns or technical barriers \cite{perisic16, mccalman17, vlacheas13}. Despite these challenges, the strengths of ML and the IoT strongly outweigh their shortcomings, making them a viable future technology for the sustainable design of homes and businesses.

\section{Understanding the Technologies}
Before discussing the viability or effectiveness of machine learning and the IoT, it is important to understand how they work.
\subsection{Machine Learning}
While the concept of artificial intelligence predates the common era \cite{mccorduck04}, the term ``machine learning'' was not coined until 1959 by Arthur Samuel \cite{samuel59}. The basic principle behind machine learning is to allow computers to complete tasks without being explicitly told how to. This technique enables machines to solve complex problems that are either too complicated for traditional algorithms to handle or lack a working traditional algorithm altogether.
