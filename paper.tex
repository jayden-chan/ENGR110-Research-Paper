\section{Introduction}
The recent surge in computational power and dataset availability has led to a significant increase in the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) \cite{chan17}. In addition to this, advances in microelectronics and network infrastructure have enabled hardware manufacturers to create internet-connected devices for use in homes and businesses. This technology is commonly referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT). The combination of these two technologies can aid significantly in the development of sustainable homes and businesses. The integration of these technologies, however, is not without its challenges, the biggest of which involve ethical concerns or technical barriers \cite{perisic16, mccalman17, pang15}. Despite these challenges, the benefits of ML and the IoT strongly outweigh their shortcomings, making them a viable future technology for the sustainable design of homes and businesses.
